1) It fared much better with the random ghost than directional ghost because it

2) If I were to design a ghost agent, I'd design one that really takes into the account the movements of the other ghosts around it so that it could eventually corner pacman and he would have a hard time getting out of the situation. A lot of players find the random ghosts easy because they are all autonomous in a way and do not really try to find ways to corner or trap pacman with the other ghosts so they become quite easy to avoid.

3) 1. For any values that are larger than or equal to 6. 2. Yes it did because the next step will be maximization.
