2) If I were to design a ghost agent, I'd design one that really takes into the account the movements of the other ghosts around it so that it could eventually corner pacman and he would have a hard time getting out of the situation. A lot of players find the random ghosts easy because they are all autonomous in a way and do not really try to find ways to corner or trap pacman with the other ghosts so they become quite easy to avoid.
