    "The page includes questions requiring implementation of some of the search algorithms we studied in class. Make sure to download the pacman project zip file from the above link. Do not use Assignment 1’s zip file because there are some small changes. You can, however, use your search.py and searchAgents.py files if they are helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Alpha-beta is an extension of MiniMax. Therefore, if you divide the work you probably don’t want to assign Minimax to one student and alpha-beta to the other. Implementing alpha-beta without first implementing Minimax will be very challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The assignment uses the term \"depth\" to mean one pacman move *and* all the ghosts move (also known as a \"ply\"). This differs from the notes, so be sure to take this into account when implementing. \n",

    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of your pacman alpha-beta agent when it plays against the directional ghost, the random ghost and a mini-max ghost. Analyze and discuss your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to design a ghost agent to play with people, how would you go about choosing a strategy for the ghost? Think about the strategies people might use when playing this game, and how they might differ from strategies played by computer agents.\n",
